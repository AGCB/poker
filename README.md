## Problems
* Global space is polluted with all of the variables I've created to do the work.
* Extremely non-functional approach. I'm banging on arrays with for loops all over the place.
* There aren't betting rounds
* There is no interactivity for even 1 player, let alone 10
* There is no setup for taking real money/crypto to use for this. Everyone starts with 100coins.
* The HTML5 Canvas element is totally non-responsive (in the web-design sense of the word)
* It's not entirely obvious from the way I've drawn the middle what the difference is between burn and turn/river cards
* There isn't a way to have players opt out for a round. It's stuck with 10 players for ever.
* I haven't drawn any actual cards in this app. I've just written text to say what cards everyone has.
* I've been told that an obvious sign of the need for refactoring is when you squint your eyes and a bunch of code looks the same. I'm using Sublime Text editor and the mini-map shows me that I've got whole sections that this applies to.
* There is no modularity. All of the code is shoved into a single 1K line html file.
